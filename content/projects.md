# Current projects

## 1. Lingua Franca
I am an active contributor to the [Lingua Franca](https://lflang.org) project. Lingua Franca is a polyglot coordination language for concurrent, time-sensitive applications. 


## 2. PRET machines
I am interested in time-predictable CPU architectures. I am currently working on [InterPRET](https://github.com/lf-lang/interpret) a time-predictable multi-core CPU.


## 3. HW/SW codesign
I am also working on languages and frameworks for hardware-software codesign targeting SoC FPGAs. Check out [fpga-tidbits](https://github.com/maltanar/fpga-tidbits) and [reactor-chisel](https://github.com/erlingrj/reactor-chisel)
